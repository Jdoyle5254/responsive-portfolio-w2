              Hello!  My name is Jen Doyle and I welcome you to my world.    I am a fun loving dynamic individual and I try to make the world around me the same.   I laugh a lot and I like to meet new people and learn from them.     I have a lot of passions that include football, travel, reading, cooking, and music.   I love to explore new places.  I am always snapping pictures of something that interests me.   Some fun facts, I have worn a different concert t-shirt each night to class.   I will need to wear 72 different concert shirts before the program ends.  I am pretty sure my collection is big enough to cover that time frame.  During the quarantine I worked on my baking skills.   When I am not at home learning how to code, I can be found wandering around my neighborhood or relaxing by the lake.

              The pictures here are from some of my very memorable trips I have taken in the last few years.  Being able to capture an image and then being able to share it with people is very exciting.   The top picture is from a trip to Alaska.  Alaska is so rugged and pure, there is no place like it that I have ever seen.     That trip there was actually two forest fires  going around Anchorage.   We met several people that had gotten stuck on the highway due to the fires jumping the highway.    This was also the first time I had ever seen a glacier.   They are amazingly beautiful.  The below picture is from a trip to Italy when we were in Venice.   The only day of our tripe that it stormed.    That was the grand canal after a rainstorm and we were the only ones out on the water.     That was such a wonderful experience.
