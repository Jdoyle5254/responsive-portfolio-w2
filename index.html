              Hello! My name is Jen Doyle and I welcome you to my portfolio site. The journey to get here has been paved
              with life experiences both happy and sad. Everything you see on this site is a culmination of my life
              experiences and my passions coming together to create sites as unique as I am. My passions are travel,
              writing, cooking, music, and reading. I like to draw on these passions for inspiration for my creations
              you see here. In addition to these passions I am a lifelong learner and I am always wanting to learn and
              try new things.
            </p>

              The pictures here are from some of my very memorable trips I have taken in the last few years. Being able
              to capture an image and then being able to share it with people is very exciting. The top picture is from
              a trip to Italy. That was the canal after a rainstorm and we were the only ones out on the water. The
              below picture is from a trip to Alaska. Alaska is so rugged and pure, there is no place like it that I
              have ever seen. Being able to create something special for people to share is a gift. When I found the
              desire to go into Web Development, it awakened my creative passions and I found an outlet that I can
              create something and share it, much like my travel pics created a memory that I can share with everyone.
